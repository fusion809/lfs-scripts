# LFS scripts
This repository contains the shell scripts I use on Linux From Scratch. The check-updates.sh script is a script to determine whether the versions of each package in my LFS VM are outdated. It refers to functions.sh. The zshrc file, Shell folder and root folder contain the scripts I place in ~/, ~/Shell and /root, respectively on my LFS system to make my life on LFS easier.
